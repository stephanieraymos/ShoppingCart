# ShoppingCart

This is a personal project I did to boost my creativity. 
It's a band site for the Beatles that includes a tours page, an about page and a store page. 

The store page was the most difficult portion and includes the ability to add items to the cart, 
delete items from the cart, and has a button to simulate a completed purchase. 
When item are added to or deleted from the cart, or if the quantity is updated; the total updates respectively.
When the purchase is complete, the cart resets and is empty again.
